I adjusted the items, checkers, and run time. 
I increased the number of items to 200, making each transaction period take longer to both shop and checkout. 
I also increased the number of checkers to 20 to handle the larger load better.
I extended the run time from 3 to 4 hours to see what a larger sample of the behavior might look like.
